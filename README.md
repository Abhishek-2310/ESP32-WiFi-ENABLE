<h1>WiFi-Enable any Project with ESP32 and ESP-IDF</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
This project provides a comprehensive guide on how to enable WiFi connectivity for any project using the ESP32 microcontroller and the esp-idf (Espressif IoT Development Framework). The ESP32 is a powerful and versatile microcontroller that supports WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity, making it an excellent choice for Internet of Things (IoT) projects, home automation, sensor monitoring, and more.
</p>
<p>
By following the instructions and code examples in this repository, you'll be able to quickly integrate WiFi capabilities into your projects, allowing them to communicate with other devices, cloud services, and the internet.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Easy integration of WiFi connectivity into any project.</li>
<li>Utilizes the popular ESP32 microcontroller.</li>
<li>Step-by-step guide for setting up and configuring the project.</li>
<li>Example code for common WiFi communication scenarios.</li>
<li>Robust and reliable esp-idf framework for efficient development.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before getting started with this project, make sure you have the following hardware and software requirements:</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<ul>
<li>ESP32 development board (e.g., ESP-WROOM-32, ESP32-DevKitC, etc.)</li>
<li>Micro-USB cable for programming and power supply</li>
<li>Breadboard and jumper wires (for prototyping, if needed)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Software</h3>
<ul>
<li>ESP-IDF installed on your development machine.</li>
<li>A compatible Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for ESP-IDF, such as Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO or Eclipse IDE with the ESP-IDF extension.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to set up the project and start adding WiFi capabilities to your project:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone or download this GitHub repository to your local development machine.</li>
        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Abhishek-2310/ESP32-WiFi-ENABLE.git</code></pre>
        <li>Connect your ESP32 development board to your computer using the Micro-USB cable.</li>
        <li>Open the project folder in your preferred IDE for ESP-IDF.</li>
        <li>Configure the project's WiFi settings in the <code>main/config.h</code> file. Update the SSID and password to
            match your WiFi network credentials.</li>
        <pre><code>#define WIFI_SSID "YourWiFiSSID"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "YourWiFiPassword"</code></pre>
        <li>Compile and flash the project to your ESP32 development board.</li>
        <li>Monitor the serial output to check the WiFi connection status and any debug messages.</li>
        <li>Once connected to the WiFi network, explore the example code in the <code>main</code> folder to learn how to
            send and receive data over WiFi.</li>
    </ol>
